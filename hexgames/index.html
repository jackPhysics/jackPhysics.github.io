    <h1>Hexagon based wargames - old and new!</h1>
    <h1>Play Here!</h1>

    <p class="first">Before you visit these pages note there are various key-board shortcuts available to help (press the HELP button to find out more).<br> 
      There are buttons available lower down for calling up CRTs, TECs etc 
      or a help sheet that lists the keyboard short cuts. 
      Most of the shortcuts can also be accessed through the 'hopper' which appears whenever you click on a piece.<br>
    Pieces can be moved by dragging or by clicking to choose and then clicking on where you want them to go.</p>
    <p class="first">The most important shortcut to know at the start is the "1" key shrinks the board and pieces (zoom out),<br>
      and the "2" expands the board and pieces (zoom in).</p>

    <h1 class="kr">AVALON HILL'S KRIEGSPIEL (1970)</h1>
    <p>Play the original game or try out new armies and/or new boards.<br>
    It's best to select new armies/boards before starting to play - changing halfway through a game could lead to unpredictable results!</p>
    
   <h2 class="kr"><a href="ks/Krieg vP12 n1.html" target="_blank">Kriegspiel - Square board</a></h2>
    
   <h2 class="kr"><a href="ks/Krieg vP12L n1.html" target="_blank">Kriegspiel - Long board</a></h2>

  
    <h1 class="ps">SPI'S PRESTAGS (1976)</h1>
  
     <h2 class="ps"><a href="px/prestags vplayTest.html" target="_blank">Playtesting Prestags</a></h2>
    <p>This module allows you to choose from all the Prestags boards but also many other boards (eg Dark Ages, Kampfpanzer! etc.)<br>
    - you can turn terrain features on or off and use part of the board or all of the board<br>
      (use the x++/x-- and y++/y-- buttons to move the board around)<br>
    (use the width+- and height+- buttons to use more or less of the boards)</p>
    <p>It is designed as a 'playtest' space and so armies are all one type or a limited range of types (every force is 24 points)<br>
    so rules governing ranged fire, cavalry movement, infantry classes, weapon effectiveness, chariots, slopes etc can all be judged in isolation.</p>
    <p>Try SD v BI, or HC v LB, or MI v PP...</p>
    <p>There are no leader units in this module.</p>
    <p>On opening, the 1st forces presented are not a real force but an example of every possible piece in the original game.</p>
      
   <h2 class="ps"><a href="px2/playPrestags v1.html" target="_blank">Play Prestags</a></h2>
    <p>This is the 'Playtesting' module (see above) adapted to play actual scenarios (4 at the moment but more will become available).
    <p>Press the "Setup Game" button (bottom left) and it will cycle through the scenarios available.</p>
    <p>This module has leader units (they can be changed with the 'C' button, and some units can be changed (eg LB to AX), MC and HC can dismount.</p>
    <p>You can also choose the individual armies and choose your own board to create your own scenarios.</p>

  <h2 class="ps"><a href="px2/playPrestagsFull v1.html" target="_blank">Play Prestags v2</a></h2>
    <p>As above but here there is a single button that chooses the scenario directly.
    <p>You will need 'pop-ups enabled' as the scenario instructions appear within a pop-up.</p>
    <p>There is a button ('situation') to re-open the situation window if you close it.</p>
     
    <h1 class="ps">Individual PRESTAGS scenarios:</h1>
    
    <p>Pressing the 'Setup Game' button near the bottom left will move pieces into starting positions 
      - pressing more than once may give alternative starting positions.</p>
    <p>The 'playtesting' module renders board and pieces on the fly using javascript, this module uses .jpg, .png or .gif images of the boards and pieces.</p>
    <p>These versions allow the changing of units (eg LB to AX, dismounting cavalry etc) - use the 'C' button</p>
