    <h1>Hexagon based wargames - old and new!</h1>
    <h1>Play Here!</h1>

    <p>Before you visit these pages note there are various key-board shortcuts available to help.<br> 
      There are also buttons available lower down for calling up CRTs, TECs etc 
      or a help sheet that lists the keyboard short cuts. 
      Most of the shortcuts can also be accessed through the 'hopper' which appears whenever you click on a piece.<br>
    Pieces can be moved by dragging or by clicking to choose and then clicking on where you want them to go.</p>
    <p>The most important shortcut to know at the start is the "1" key shrinks the board and pieces (zoom out),<br>
      and the "2" expands the board and pieces (zoom in).</p>

    <h1 class="kr">AVALON HILL'S KRIEGSPIEL (1970)</h1>
    <p>Play the original game or try out new armies and/or new boards.<br>
    It's best to select new armies/boards before starting to play - changing halfway through a game could lead to unpredictable results!</p>

    <p>This module allows you to choose the 'Chariot', 'Spartan' or 'Yeoman' board<br>
    - you can turn terrain features on or off and use part of the board or all <br>
      (use the x+-5 and y+-5 buttons to move the board around)<br>
    (use the width+- and height+- buttons to use more or less of the boards)</p>
    <p>It is designed as a 'playtest' space and so armies are all one type or a limited range of types (every army is 24 points)<br>
    so rules governing ranged fire, cavalry movement, infantry classes etc can all be judged in isolation.</p>
    <p>I'll soon develop a similar module that includes actual armies from tthe differentt  scenarios so that different scenarios can be played.</p>
    
   <h2 class="ps"><a href="ps/hattin_newJS.html">Prestags: Hattin</a></h2>
    <p>Pressing the 'Setup Game' butto near the bottom leftt willl mov pieces into starting positions 
      - it can often be pressed more than once to give alternative starting positions.</p>
    <p>Other scenarios will become available soon</p>
    <p>The 'playtesting' module renders board and pieces on the fly using javascript, this module uses .jpg, .png or .gif images of the boards and pieces.</p>
