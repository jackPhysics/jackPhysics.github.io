</table>
<p>Repeating the code reverses the effect.<br>
Upper or lower-case code letters should work.</p>

<p><b>To move a unit</b> click on it to select it, then click on where you want it to move to - your second click cannot be on top of another piece but must be on the actual map-board (the program remembers where you clicked on the piece and will place it at its new place in the same relative position to the mouse point) (pieces can overlap - but not exactly, if you want them to overlap exactly, so one piece is hidden under another, try using the "0,O,P,L" keys to manuever it and then use "9" to unselect it)</p>

<p>Clicking a second time on the same piece unselects it - clicking the second time on a second piece also unselects the first piece but does not select the second, you'll need to click again on the second piece to do that.</p>

<p>When a piece is selected if you press any of the keys "x", "u", or "m" the piece will be altered in some way as mentioned in the keycodes above. Eliminated units are placed in their respective sides 'dead units area'.</p>


<p class="title">SAVING THE POSITION</p>
<p>The game can be saved at any time. What is being saved is a 'snapshot' of where all the pieces are on the board and what state they are in.</p>
<p>To save a position follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Check all the pieces are as you want them to be saved - check the 'Game Turn' marker, check the game-turn calculator, check the City Control boxes, do you want to leave units marked or unmarked? "--REMEMBER TO PICK APPROPRIATE TURN BUTTON BEFORE CREATING SAVE DATA..."" - this determines which side is hidden when a new game is re-loaded with hidden movement chosen.
<li>Press the 'create save-data' button located at the bottom of the screen
<li>A new window will pop up full of numbers seperated by commas - this is the data that provides the 'snapshot'
<li>In this new window choose <b><u>E</u>dit | Select <u>A</u>ll</b> to highlight all the data
<li>Then choose <b><u>E</u>dit | <u>C</u>opy</b> to copy all the data
<ul>
<li>DO NOT choose <b><u>F</u>ile | Save <u>A</u>s...</b> or <b><u>F</u>ile | <u>S</u>ave</b> in the new window as this will not save the data correctly!</ul>
<li>Open a Notepad window (<b>Start | <u>P</u>rograms | Accessories | Notepad</b>)
<li>Paste your copied data into this Notepad window (<b><u>E</u>dit | <u>P</u>aste</b>)
<li>Now save this Notepad window in order to save your data... Choose <b><u>F</u>ile | Save <u>A</u>s...</b> from the Notepad menu bar. Save the file with an appropriate name in an appropriate place.
<ul><li>You could then clear the Notepad window ( <b><u>E</u>dit | Select <u>A</u>ll</b> then press the <b>Delete</b> key) and so have it all ready for the next bit of data you want to save.</ul>
</ol>

<p class="title">RELOADING THE POSITION</p>
<p>Before re-loading a new position you MUST 'Refresh' the game. This is done by pressing the 'Refresh' button on the toolbar or choosing <b><u>V</u>iew | <u>R</u>efresh</b> (or pressing the 'F5' key). 'Refreshing' wipes out all existing moves and puts the game back to initial positions. Check you do not want to save your position before you 'refresh'.</p>
<p>To re-load a position follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your data should be saved in a .txt file somewhere
<li>Find the appropriate file and double-click it to open it
<li>The data will be opened up in its own Notepad window. Select the data by choosing <b><u>E</u>dit | Select <u>A</u>ll</b>
<li>Copy the data by choosing <b><u>E</u>dit | <u>C</u>opy</b>
<li>We will now paste the data into the game: <b>right</b>-click with the mouse over the 're-load' box at the very bottom of the game screen - this will pop-up a little menu of options - choose <b><u>P</u>aste</b>
<li>The data should all now be visible inside the 're-load' box - press the 'press to re-load' button
<li>Voila!
</ol>
