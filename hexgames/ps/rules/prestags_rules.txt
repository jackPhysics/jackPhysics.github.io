[1.0] INTRODUCTION
PRESTAGS — Pre-Seventeenth Century 
Tactical Game System — is a 
simulation of the art of warfare 
from 3000 B.C. to 1550 A.D. Each 
game in the series covers a segment 
of that period, and presents the 
tactical situations faced by the 
leaders of the great battles of the 
period. These battles are presented 
as scenarios, in which are given a 
mix of units from the counter sheet 
and their historical posture at the 
outset of the battle. Similarly, the 
map represents a typical mix of 
terrain, and each battle is fought 
in areas of the map which closely 
simulate the actual historical 
terrain.

Two folders are provided. The first 
contains Standard Rules, which are 
common to all the games in the 
PRESTAGS series, and Optional Rules, 
which may be used in any game at the 
Players choice. The second folder 
contains unique Scenarios for the 
specific PRESTAGS game you have 
purchased, and Exclusive Rules for 
this game only.



[2.0] GENERAL
COURSE OF PLAY
Each scenario is played in sequenced 
turns (called Game-Turns) during 
which Players move their units on 
the map and engage in two types of 
combat using Fire (missile) and 
Melee (contact) weapons. While 
maneuvering and engaging in combat, 
they frequently try to achieve 
certain geographic objectivçs on the 
map.

[2.11 GAME SCALE
Each hex in PRESTAGS represents 50 
meters from side to side. Each unit 
represents 100-125 men and/or 
horses. Each Game-Turn represents 
five minutes.

[2.21 LEARNING THE GAME
The army has started using a system 
called “Peer Group Instruction”. The 
instructor spends a lot of time with 
only one or two people to teach them 
how to do a particular job. Once 
trained, these people go off and 
instruct others in the job. It is a 
far more efficient system that takes 
advantage of the superiority of 
personal attention in any learning 
situation. Not to belabor the 
obvious, but the best way to learn 
PRESTAGS, or any other conflict 
simulation, is to learn it from 
someone who has played already.

If this is not possible and you must 
learn the game on your own, do the 
following:
a. Look at all the components.
b. Scan the rules quickly, but read 
all diagrams and tables word-for-
word.
c. Punch out the counters and set-up 
the simplest scenario (the one with 
the fewest counters).
d. Play the scenario “solitaire” 
with the Sequence of Play (4.0) in 
front of you.
e. After making a few moves, read 
the rules word-for-word.


[3.0] GAME EQUIPMENT [3.1] GAME MAP
The 23” by 35” mapsheet represents 
terrain typical of that on which the 
battles were fought. Its area is 
roughly 1.8 by 2.8 kilometers. The 
different terrain features affect 
movement and combat. An hexagonal 
grid is superimposed over this 
terrain to regulate movement, range, 
and the position of the playing 
pieces. In order to make the map lie 
flat, backfold the creases, and 
optionally make use of small pieces 
of masking tape to hold and protect 
the map.

[3.2] GAME CHARTS AND TABLES
Various visual aids are provided for 
the Players to simplify and 
illustrate certain game functions. 
Chief amongst these are the Combat 
Results Table which is used to show 
the effects of attacks), and Turn 
Record (to keep track of elapsed 
time), and the Terrain Effects Chart 
(showng the effects of the various 
terrain hexes on movement and 
combat).

[3.3] THE PLAYING PIECES
Two differently colored sets of 
playing pieces (henceforth known as 
units) are supplied. The Players are 
assigned certain of these to 
represent the opposing armies in 
each scenario. The playing pieces 
are distinguished by type, strength, 
and mobility, as represented by the 
numbers on the face of the counter. 
These numbers are always in the same 
position for a particular 
characteristic of the unit. On 
different units, the numbers may 
change, but it is still the same 
basic arrangement. Note that fire 
units have two additional numbers 
(compared to solely melee units): 
Range Allowance and Fire Combat 
Strength.

13.31] Sample Melee Unit
 
[3.34] “ALL-AROUND” COMBAT STRENGTH:
The Combat Strength of a unit is 
applicable in all directions. There 
is no particular direction (usually 
called “facing”) ever assigned to a 
unit (exception:
see Optional Rule 16.0).

[3.351 DefinItions of Terms
Melee Combat Strength is the number 
quantifying the basic offensive and 
defensive power of a unit when 
engaged in Melee Combat. It is 
expressed in terms of Strength 
Points.
Fire Attack Strength is the number 
quantifying the basic offensive 
strength of a unit when firing its 
ranged missile weapons. Note that 
only a few units have this 
characteristic.
Range Allowance is the maximum 
number of hexes through which a fire 
unit may fire. i.e., apply its Fire 
Attack Strength, subject to certain 
restrictions. Range includes the 
target hex, but not the firing hex.
Fire units are those which have the 
characteristics of Fire Attack 
Strength and Range Allowance. Melee 
units are those which have no fire 
characteristics, i.e., they are non-
fire units.
Some units have both a Fire Attack 
Strength and a Melee Combat 
Strength; these units are considered 
Fire units.

[3.36] Dot Melee Value
Certain units have a dot (.) instead 
of a Melee Combat Strength. These 
units may not engage in offensive 
Melee Combat, and are considered to 
have a defensive Melee Combat 
Strength of Zero when stacked with 
units which do have a Melee Combat 
Strength. When not stacked with such 
a unit (and when calculating Victory 
Points) each unit with a Dot Melee 
Value is considered to have a Melee 
Combat Strength of I.

[3.371 Bracketed Melee Combat 
Strengths
Certain units have a Melee Combat 
Strength which is enclosed in 
brackets [1. These units have a 
Melee Defense Strength one-half of 
the printed number within the 
brackets. Brackets have no effect 
upon a unit’s Combat Strength in 
attack. Therefore, a unit with a 
bracketed Combat Strength of “four” 
would melee attack with four 
strength points, but would melee 
defend with two strength points. 
Brackets do not affect the Fire 
Protection Strength of any hex. 
Fractions are retained in computing 
one-half of Combat Strength.

types employed in the PRESTAGS

[4.0] SEQUENCE OF PLAY
14.1] THE GAME-TURN
PRESTAGS is played in sequenced 
Game-Turns;
each Game-Turn is composed of two 
Player-Turns.
Each Player-Turn is composed of four 
phases.
Players must strictly follow the 
Sequence of Play.
The Game-Turn proceeds as follows:

[4.2] SEQUENCE OUTLINE
1.	FIRST PLAYER-TURN
The First Player is designated by 
the individual scenario. The Player 
whose turn is in progress is termed 
the Phasing Player.
A. Fire Combat Phase: The First 
(Phasing) Player executes Fire 
Attacks against Enemy units within 
his own units’ Range Allowance.
B. Movement Phase: The Phasing 
Player may move all of his units up 
to the limits of the units’ Movement 
Allowance, within the restrictions 
of the Movement Rules. At the end of 
this, the non-Phasing Player has the 
option to execute Defensive Fire 
(see 6.4).
C.	Melee Combat Phase: The Phasing 
Player executes all melee attacks 
against adjacent Enemy units, 
according to the rules for Melee 
Combat.
D.	Mutual DIsruption Recovery Phase: 
All disruption markers are removed, 
except from those units which 
suffered disruption in any Phase of 
the current Player-Turn. This mutual 
phase occurs at the end of each 
Player-Turn.
2. SECOND PLAYER-TURN
The Second Player follows the same 
sequence and procedures as the First 
Player, using his own units and 
assuming the role of the Phasing 
Player.
3. TURN RECORD
One of the Players advances the 
Game-Turn marker on the Turn Record 
one position to indicate that one 
Game-Turn has been completed.



[5.0] MOVEMENT

GENERAL RULE:
During the Movement Phase of a 
Player’s turn, the
Player may move as many or as few of 
his units as
he wishes. Each unit may expend as 
many
Movement Points as desired within 
the limits of its
Movement Allowance.

PROCEDURE:
Each unit is moved by tracing the 
path of its movement through the 
hexagonal grid.

[5.1] HOW TO MOVE UNITS

[5.11] Movement is calculated in 
terms of hexagons. Basically, each 
unit expends one Movement Point of 
its total Movement (point) Allowance 
for each hex entered. To enter some 
types of hexes, it may be required 
to expend more than one Movement 
Point. See the Movement section of 
the Terrain Effects Chart for a full 
list of terrain “entry costs”.
[5.12] In any given Movement Phase 
of a Player-Turn, the Player may 
move all, some or none of his units. 
Movement is never required, it is 
always voluntary.
[5.13] Units are moved individually, 
in any direction or combination of 
directions. A unit may be moved as 
many or as few hexes as the owning 
Player desires, as long as its 
Movement Allowance is not exceeded 
in a single Movement Phase. Unused 
Movement Points, however, may not be 
accumulated from Phase to Phase, nor 
transferred from unit to unit.

[5.14] Units may be moved only once 
each Movement Phase.
[5.15] An undisrupted unit may 
always be moved one hex in any 
direction into any passable terrain. 
This is to prevent units from being 
trapped through loss of Movement 
Points or terrain entry costs. if 
this technique is used, the one hex 
is the only hex to which the unit 
may move for the turn.

[5.2] MOVEMENT PROHIBITIONS

[5.21] No Enemy movement is 
permitted during a Player’s Movement 
Phase.

[5.22] No fire or melee combat 
(except for Defensive Fire, see 6.4) 
occurs during a Movement Phase.

[5.23] Units may never enter or pass 
through a hex containing Enemy 
units.
[5.24] In a given Movement Phase, 
once a unit has been moved and the 
Player’s hand withdrawn from the 
piece, it may not be moved again, 
nor may it retrace and change its 
move.
[5.25] Units may move over different 
types of terrain hexes in the same 
Movement Phase as long as they have 
enough Movement Points to expend as 
they enter each hex.
[5.26] Units may always move through 
a hex containing Friendly units. 
Stacking limitations do not apply 
during the Movement Phase (see:
Stacking, 5.4).
[5.27] in any Movement Allowance 
adjustment, fractions are retained. 
A unit without sufficient Movement 
Points to complete a move may not 
move into a hex.

[5.31 UNIT ORGANIZATION
AND COMPATABILITY
[5.31] Non-fire units are organized 
into three classes: A, B and C (see 
3.4).

[5.32] Non-fire units of the same 
class may occupy the same hex in any 
combination. Non-fire units of 
different classes may never be in 
the same hex.

[5.33] Fire units are organized into 
two classes, Foot Fire (FF) and 
Mounted Fire (MF) (see 3.4).

[5.34] Fire units of the same class 
may occupy the same hex in any 
combination; fire units of different 
classes may never be in the same 
hex.

[5.35] Foot Fire units may be mixed 
with Class A or Class B non-fire 
units. (They could not be mixed with 
both in the same hex because of the 
prohibition against mixing Class A 
and B, case
5.32.)

[5.36] Mounted Fire units may be 
mixed with Class C non-fire units.
[5.37] Miscellaneous units are 
grouped in Class D. Class D units 
may mix with their own Class and all 
other classes as long as no other 
prohibitions (above cases) are 
violated.
[5.38] Leader units are grouped in 
Class E. Class E units may mix with 
their own class and all other 
classes as long as no other 
prohibitions (above cases) are 
violated.

[5.39] UnIt CapabilIty Chart
(See the mapsheet)

[5.4] STACKING
Each Player has a certain stacking 
limitation assigned to him in a 
given scenario. At the end of the 
Player’s Movement Phase, he may have 
no more than the stated limit of 
units in any single hex. Stacking 
limitations apply at all times 
except during the Movement Phase. 
(The restrictions apply at the end 
of Movement.)
[5.41] All units in the same hex 
always defend as one, indivisible 
total of Strength Points. The 
Attacker may not in any way 
separately attack Enemy units placed 
on one hex.
[5.42] Leader and information 
counters (Disruption and contact 
markers) do not count for stacking 
purposes. They are ignored.
[5.43] A stack may he moved together 
at the movement rate of the slowest 
Movement Allowance in the stack, or 
faster units may separate at any 
point during the move.

[5.5] ROADS

[5.51] A unit which moves from one 
road hex directly into an adjacent 
road hex through a road hexside 
expends only one Movement Point, 
regardless of other terrain in the 
hex.
 
[5.52] A unit which moves into a 
road hex through a non-road hexside 
must pay the entry cost of the other 
terrain in the hex.

[5.53] Roads have no effect upon 
combat (consider the effects of 
other terrain in hex).

[5.6] SLOPES
[5.611 A unit which moves into a 
Slope hex must always expend two 
Movement Points to enter the hex 
(unless it is moving by road). The 
cost for entering a Slope hex 
remains two Movement Points whether 
the unit is moving “up” or “down” or 
across” the Slope.

[5.62] A unit which moves from a 
Slope hex, into an adjacent Hilltop 
hex, through a hexside marked by the 
Slope splash symbol, expends two 
Movement Points.

[6.0] FIRE COMBAT
GENERAL RULE:
Players engage in Fire Combat during 
the Friendly Fire Combat Phase. The 
Phasing Player is considered to be 
the attacker, and the non-Phasing 
Player is considered to be the 
defender. A Fire unit may attack any 
hex within the number of hexes 
indicated by the unit’s Range 
Allowance if there is a clear Line 
of Sight to the target (see: 6.34).

PROCEDURE:
During the Fire Combat Phase, the 
Phasing Player allocates units to 
attack Enemy occupied hexes. Each 
attack is resolved by comparing the 
total of all the attacking units’ 
Fire Combat Strengths to the Fire 
Protection Strength (given on the 
Terrain Effects Chart) of the hex 
the defending units are
in. This comparison is stated as a 
ratio of Attacker’s Strength to 
Defender’s Strength; this is 
simplified to conform to one of the 
Combat Odds shown on the Combat 
Results Table. The die is rolled and 
the result is cross-referenced with 
the appropriate Combat Odds column, 
yielding the result. Each Combat 
result is fully applied before 
initiating another combat action.


[6.11 WHICH UNITS MAY ATTACK

[6.11] Fire units may not engage in 
offensive Melee Combat in the same 
Friendly Player-Turn as that in 
which they have engaged in Fire 
Combat. They may move.
[6.12] Fire units may not engage in 
Fire Combat in consecutive Player-
Turns. Thus, a fire unit engaging in 
Fire Combat in its own Friendly 
Player-Turn may not engage in 
Defensive Fire in the Enemy Player-
Turn immediately following (see 
Defensive Fire, case 6.4).
[6.131 Fire units may only fire 
attack Enemy units within the number 
of hexes of their Range Allowance 
(see: 6.32).

[6.14] Not every unit in a stack 
need participate in an attack made 
by a unit or units in their stack. 
They may engage in other attacks, or 
none at all.
16.15] No unit may participate in 
more than one attack per Combat 
Phase. No unit may be attacked more 
than once per Combat Phase.

[6.16] A unit may not execute a Fire 
Attack against Enemy units located 
in two or more hexes.

[6.2] COMBAT ALLOCATION
AND RESOLUTION
[6.21] There is no limit to the 
number of fire units that may fire 
into a given hex. Different fire 
units may attack the same hex, even 
if they are at different firing 
ranges, of different unit types, or 
in different hexes. The Fire Attack 
Strengths of units attacking into a 
given hex are always combined.
[6,22] The defensive Strength of a 
unit(s) in a hex under Fire Attack 
is dictated by the hex’s terrain.
A Fire Protection Strength is listed 
for each type of hex on the Terrain 
Effects Chart. A ratio is arrived at 
by comparing the Attacker’s Fire 
Attack Strength to the Fire 
Protection Strength of the 
Defender’s hex. The ratio is reduced 
to a Combat Odds. The number of 
units defendIng against a fire 
attack has no bearing on the Fire 
Protection Strength of the hex.
[6.23] In Fire Combat, combat 
results apply to all units in the 
affected hex.

[6.3]	FIRE ATTACK PROHIBITIONS AND 
RESTRICTIONS
[6.31] A single fire unit may never 
attack more than a single hex, nor 
may its Fire Combat Strength be 
split in any way.

[6.32] Fire units may not fire 
through village or woods hexes to 
reach a target. They may fire into 
or from village or woods hexes.

6.331 Ff units may not fire from 
stream or ford hexes. They may fire 
from bridge hexes, and may fire into 
river, ford and bridge hexes.

[634] A Fire unit must have a Line 
of Sight (LOS) to fire. To determine 
the hexes of the LOS, lay a straight 
edge along the centers of the firing 
and target hexes. If any portion of 
this line passes through hexes 
considered “blocking” terrain or 
through hexes so occupied as to be 
“blocking”, the Fire unit may not 
fire into that hex.

[6.35] Units on a slope may fire 
into, but not through a hilltop hex.

[6.36] Slope hexes block fire unless 
either the firing or the target unit 
is on a hilltop hex which is 
adjacent to the slope hex in 
question. (Important! Be sure to 
understand this.)
 
[6.37] The Line of Sight of a unit 
may be blocked by a hex occupied by 
any unit, Enemy or Friendly, 
depending upon the elevation of the 
firing unit. There are three 
possible elevations: Ground level 
hexes, Slope hexes and Hilltop 
hexes. When in a Ground level hex, a 
unit may not fire through any 
occupied hex. When in a Slope hex, a 
unit may not fire through an 
occupied Slope hex or Hilltop hex, 
but it may fire through occupied 
Ground level hexes. A unit in a 
Hilltop hex may not fire through 
occupied hexes unless its Line of 
Sight goes through an adjacent Slope 
hex, in which case it may fire 
through occupied hexes. If the Line 
of Sight of a unit in a Hilltop hex 
crosses a nonadjacent hexside marked 
by the Slope splash symbol, it is 
blocked, beyond that point, by 
occupied hexes.
 
[6.38] If a Line of Sight falls 
coincidentally along a hexside 
between two hexes, the LOS is clear 
if either hex is unblocked. If both 
hexes are blocked (for reasons of 
terrain, occupation, or both), the
LOS is blocked. A LOS is blocked by 
falling along a hexside whose two 
hexes have two different blocked 
characteristics.
 
[6.4] DEFENSIVE FIRE

[6.41] All undisrupted fire units 
have rigid Defensive Fire Zones for 
movement purposes:
when any Enemy unit moves adjacent 
to a Friendly fire unit, the Enemy 
unit must stop. The Enemy unit may 
move no further in that Movement 
Phase.
[6.42] At the completion of all 
Enemy movement during the Movement 
Phase, all Friendly fire units have 
the option to launch Defensive Fire: 
they may fire at any hex adjacent to 
them into which Enemy units moved 
during that Movement Phase.

[6.43] Defensive Fire is possible 
only if a fire unit did not fire 
attack in the previous Player-Turn. 
Fire units may never fire in 
consecutive Player-Turns; they 
require one full Player-Turn to 
prepare fire (see 6.12 and 6.52).

Therefore, if a fire unit engaged in 
an attack during a Friendly Fire 
Combat Phase, it would be unable to 
use its Defensive Fire after the 
ensuing Enemy Movement Phase. But 
all Enemy units would still have to 
end their movement if they move 
adjacent to a Friendly fire unit.

[6.44] A fire unit which is 
incapable of Defensive Fire still 
forces Enemy units to stop when they 
come adjacent to the fire unit.

[6.45] Fire units stacked together 
may fire separately, into different 
hexes. The same hex may never be 
attacked more than once in Defensive 
Fire.

[6.5] FIRE AND MELEE

[6.51] Fire units with a Melee 
Strength may attack in Melee Combat 
or in Fire Combat in a Friendly 
Player-Turn. They may never do both 
in the same Friendly Player-Turn, 
and they could not use Fire Attack 
if it had been used in Defensive 
Fire during the immediately 
preceding Enemy Player-Turn.

[6.52] It is entirely possible to 
alternate Melee Attack (on the 
Friendly Player-Turn) with Defensive 
Fire (during the Enemy Player-Turn). 
The conditions are that both Melee 
Attack and Offensive Fire cannot be 
used on the same Player-Turn; and 
that fire may not be employed on 
consecutive Player-Turns.



[7.0] MELEE COMBAT
GENERAL RULE:

Melee combat takes place during the 
Melee Combat Phase of a Player-Turn. 
The Phasing Player is considered to 
be the Attacker and the non-Phasing 
Player to be the Defender 
(regardless of their overall 
strategic position). A unit may only 
melee attack Enemy units which are 
in an adjacent hex.

PROCEDURE:
During his Melee Combat Phase, the 
Phasing Player indicates which of 
his units will be used to attack 
Enemy-occupied hexes. Then each 
separate combat action is resolved 
in turn, in any order the attacking 
Player wishes. The attacker need not
specify his attacks until they are 
made, as long as the rules of combat 
are followed.

Combat is resolved by totalling the 
Melee Strengths of the attacking 
units and comparing this to the 
total of the Melee Strengths of the 
defender. This comparison is 
expressed as a ratio of Attacker’s 
Strength to Defender’s Strength; 
this is simplified to one of the 
Combat Odds on the Combat Results 
Table. The die is rolled and the 
number is cross-referenced with the 
appropriate Combat Odds column to 
achieve a combat result. Each combat 
result is fully applied before 
initiating another combat action.

[7.1] WHICH UNITS MAY
ATTACK AND DEFEND
[7.11] Not every unit in a stack 
need participate in the same attack 
upon the same defending hex, even if 
one of the units is attacking; the 
other units may engage in other 
attacks, or none at all.

[7.12] Friendly units stacked in the 
same hex must be treated as one 
combined defensIve Melee Strength 
value when attacked.

[7.13] Any one hex may be subjected 
to only one Melee Combat during a 
Player-Turn. One unit in a stack 
cannot be singled out and attacked 
separately.

[7.14] No unit may participate in 
more than one attack per Combat 
Phase. No unit may be the object of 
more than one attack per Combat 
Phase. [7.15] Units disrupted by 
Defensive Fire Combat may not 
participate in the subsequent Melee 
Phase.
[7.2]	MULTIPLE-UNIT AND MULTI-HEX 
COMBAT

[7.21] Friendly units in different 
hexes, adjacent to the same 
defending hex, may participate in a 
combined attack against that hex 
regardless of unit class. In such a 
case, combine all the Melee Strength 
Points of the attacking units into 
one total Strength value. An Enemy-
occupied hex may be attacked by as 
many units as can be brought to 
bear. Conceivably, as many as six 
stacks of units could participate in 
an attack upon a single Enemy-
occupied hex.

[7.22] A unit or units In a single 
hex may execute an attack against 
Enemy units located in two or more 
adjacent hexes. In such a case, the 
Defending Strengths are combined for 
combat resolution.

[7.23] Attacks may involve any 
number of attacking or defending 
units on different hexes. For the 
attacks to be resolved as a single 
combat, however, all the attacking 
units must be adjacent to all the 
defending units:
[7.24] EXAMPLES
 
[7.3] COMBAT RESOLUTION

[731] Attacks may be resolved in any 
order that the Attacker wishes. The 
result of each attack must be 
applied immediately, as the attack 
is executed.

[732] Combat Odds are rounded off in 
favor of the defender to conform to 
the ratios given on the Combat 
Results Tables. For example, an 
attack of 26 Strength Points against 
9 Strength Points would be rounded 
off to a “2 to 1” odds situation.

[7.4] MELEE ATTACK INIIIBITIONS
Units may never split their Melee 
Strength and use it in two or more 
attacks in the same Combat Phase. 
The Melee Strength of the unit may 
never be used in piece-meal fashion. 
All Melee Strengths are integrated 
quantities.

[7.5] FLANKING ATTACK
[7.51] Whenever Melee-attacking 
units occupy, or are adjacent to, 
every one of the six hexes around 
the defending unit(s), the attack is 
termed a Flank Attack. Units engaged 
in a flank attack have their Melee 
Combat Strengths doubled before 
computing the combat odds of the 
attack.

Thus, if two units, each with a 
Combat Strength of “two”, were flank 
attacking a unit with a Combat 
Strength of “four”, the combat odds 
would be eight to four (2 to 1 on 
the Combat Results Table). [7.52] 
The doubling in Melee Flank Attacks 
is the final correction applied to 
combat odds (after all other 
adjustments, such as Terrain, Leader 
bonuses, etc.).

[7.53] A Flank Attack is possible 
only with units that are actually 
attacking the “flanked” unit. Mere 
presence in the necessary position 
(without attacking) is not enough 
for Flank-attack purposes.

[7.54] Units caught against 
impassable terrain or mapedges are 
not flanked unless the full 
conditions for Flank Attack (case 
7.51) are still fulfilled.

[7.55] The presence of Enemy units 
never interferes with Flank attacks 
by Friendly units.

[7.56] Fire combat never benefits 
from Flank Attack.

[7.6] MELEE STRENGTH VARIATION
Melee Strength of all units can be 
affected by the terrain they occupy. 
See the Terrain Effects Chart.



[8.0]	COMBAT RESULTS TABLE
(See the mapsheet)

[8.1] EXPLANATION OF COMBAT RESULTS
Attacks at odds less than ito 2 are 
not permitted; odds greater than 8 
to 1 are treated as 8 to 1. Results 
only affect defending units.

D = Disruption. The affected units 
are “tagged” by the placement of a 
Disruption Marker. See:
Effects of Disruption (8.2).

1AE = Half-Eliminated. One-half of 
the units attacked are eliminated 
(Defender’s choice of units), and 
the remainder are disrupted (see:
Disruption). If there are an odd 
number of units defending, the 
majority of units would be 
eliminated. Do not count Leader 
units when calcuWing “half’ of 
stack.
B = Fully Eliminated: All of the 
units attacked are eliminated; 
remove from the mapsheet.

18.2] EFFECTS OF DISRUPTION
Units which are disrupted may not 
initiate combat, employ fire, or be 
moved for the duration of their 
disruption. Disruption never affects 
Leader units
(see 10.3). When disrupted units (or 
a stack containing at least one 
disrupted unit) are attacked by Fire 
or Melee, the Attacker adds “one” to 
the die roll number before resolving 
the attack.

[8.21] Units may be disrupted during 
any one of three phases: Enemy Fire 
Combat, Enemy Melee, or after 
Friendly Movement (as a result of 
Defensive Fire).

[8.22] Units which are currently 
disrupted are eliminated if 
disrupted again.

[8.23] All disrupted units return to 
a normal state during the Mutual 
Disruption Recovery Phase, except 
for units disrupted during the 
current Player-Turn.

[8.24] in the event of one Melee 
Attack upon two hexes, one with 
disrupted units and the other 
without, the die roll is increased 
by “one” for the attack upon the hex 
with the disrupted unit. The die 
roll is unaffected for the hex 
without disrupted units. At most, 
then, an attack could have two 
results: one for hexes with 
disrupted units and one for hexes 
without disrupted Enemy units.

[83] RETREAT
Retreat is never inflicted on units.

[8.4] ADVANCE AFTER COMBAT
When any hex is vacated as a result 
of combat, the attacking units may 
advance at the Owning Player’s 
discretion into the vacated hex. 
Normal stacking limitations must be 
observed. The option to advance must 
be exercised immediately following 
the combat result.



[9.0]	TERRAIN EFFECTS CHART
(See the mapsheet)



[10.0] LEADERS
GENERAL RULE:
There are four levels of Leaders in 
PRESTAGS:
“1”, “2”, “3” and “4”. Leaders 
influence both combat and movement 
of Friendly units. Units stacked 
with a Leader are never Disrupted. 
Leaders have two characteristics: 
Leadership Combat Bonus (the digit 
printed on the lower left of the 
counter) and Movement Control Radius 
(printed on the lower right).

In some scenarios, mounted units are 
exempt from Leaders’ Movement 
Control Radius and its restrictions 
[Mounted units are understood to 
include all Class C units, Mounted 
fire units, and Chariot units (with 
their occupants).] Elephants are not 
mounted units.

PROCEDURE:
A unit (or stack of units) in the 
same hex as a Friendly Leader unit, 
and engaged in Melee Combat, 
receives additional Strength Points 
equal to the Leadership Combat 
Bonus. This bonus may never exceed 
the Combat Strength of the unit(s) 
after complete adjustment by all 
possible modifiers (Terrain, Unit 
Capability if used, etc.).

Units which begin their Friendly 
Movement Phase within the Movement 
Control Radius of a Friendly Leader 
unit may move normally with their 
full Movement Allowance. Units which 
do not begin their Movement Phase 
within the Movement Control Radius 
of a Friendly Leader unit may only 
use one-half their normal Movement 
Allowance (retain fractions).

[10.1] LEADERSHIP COMBAT BONUS
[10.11] To gain the Leadership 
Combat Bonus, units must be stacked 
with the Leader unit at the instant 
of combat. If there is more than one 
Leader
unit in a hex, all the Leaders may 
add their bonus to the other units’ 
Melee Strength. The combined bonus 
may not exceed the adjusted Combat 
Strength of all non-Leader units in 
the hex.

[10.12] A Leader may never apply his 
Combat Bonus to himself or another 
Leader unit.

[10.13] Leadership Combat Bonus 
applies in Melee Combat only, for 
both offensive and defensive combat 
situations.

[10.14] Leadership Combat Bonus may 
be applied to any number of attacks 
made by Melee Attacking units in the 
Leader’s hex.

[10.2]	LEADERSHIP MOVEMENT 
CONTROL RADIUS
[10.21] Units which begin their 
Movement Phase within a Leader’s 
Movement Control Radius may move out 
of this control during their 
Movement with no ill effects. Being 
in more than one Leader’s Movement 
Control Radius yields no additional 
movement bonus.

[10.22] Although in some scenarios, 
mounted units may be exempt from 
Leaders’ Movement Control Radius, 
the mounted units may still use the 
Leader Combat Bonus.

[10.23] Units which begin a Movement 
Phase beyond a Friendly Leader’s 
Movement Control Radius have their 
Movement Allowance cut in half 
(fractions retained).

[10.24] Undisrupted units, 
regardless of terrain and Movement 
Control modifications, may always 
move one hex (non-prohibited) per 
Movement Phase.
 
[103] LEADER REDUCTION
The four types of Leader are rated 
by steps, from “1” (best) to “4” 
(worst). Leader units in hexes 
affected by “Disruption” and “V2-
Elim” results in Melee Combat are 
replaced with a Leader unit rated 
one grade lower. A “4” level leader, 
if reduced, is eliminated.
When a Leader unit receives a 
“Disruption” or “1/2 Elim” Combat 
Result due to Melee Combat, the 
Leader unit is removed and the next 
lower grade of Leader substituted. 
An “Elim” result still causes the 
complete elimination of all units, 
including Leaders, regardless of 
level, in the affected hex.

Thus, a “2” level Leader unit in a 
hex suffering a “Disruption” result 
due to Melee Combat would be 
replaced with a “3” Leader. A “4” 
Leader suffering the same result 
would be eliminated. Leaders are 
never upgraded.
[1031] Leaders never suffer any harm 
from Fire combat. Units stacked with 
Leaders do not suffer “Disruption” 
in Fire combat (but they do sufer 
“‘/2-Elim” and “Elim” results from 
fire). It is entirely possible that 
all the units in a hex could be 
eliminated by Fire Combat and the 
Leader would remain, completely 
unaffected.

[10.32] Leaders nullify “Disruption” 
of the units they are stacked with 
from Melee Combat, but they are 
reduced one level as the “cost” of 
the nullification. The destruction 
of a “4” level Leader does “save” 
his units from Disruption on the 
turn of the Leader’s demise.

[10.33] Leaders are reduced and the 
units suffer the results of “‘/2-
Elim” and “Elim” from Melee Combat.

[10.4] SUMMARY OF
LEADER CHARACTERISTICS
(See the mapsheet)
[11.0] SCENARIOS AND
VICTORY CONDITIONS
[11.1] SCENARIO FORMAT
Each Scenario is presented in the 
following way:
(0.0) Name of Battle (Date)
A Force (the name or leader of the 
side which will
deploy and move first- unless 
otherwise specified):
Units (the type and number 
available). VP (the
Victory Point Total), PL (the Panic 
Level). Deployment (a hex 
identification letter, and distance 
from that hex that units may be set 
up). Stacking (the maximum number of 
units per hex). Leadership (see 
10.22; if mounted units are exempt, 
“Mt.Ex.” will appear).
B Force (following the same format 
as above). Game Length (in complete 
Game-Turns).

Victory Conditions (separate, 
alternate conditions
are separated by semi-colons).

Terrain Modifications.

Special Rules.

[11.2] LEVELS OF VICTORY
The Victory Conditions frequently 
specify geographic objectives, 
levels of victory, or both. The 
three levels of victory are: 
Marginal, Substantive, and Decisive. 
Victory Levels are calculated in 
terms of a ratio of Victory Points. 
For every Enemy units destroyed, the 
Victory Point total awarded is one-
half the Melee Attack Strength 
(always rounded up) plus the Fire 
Attack Strength (if any). [11.21] A 
Marginal Victory results when one 
side has a ratio of its own Victory 
Points to its opponent’s Victory 
Points greater than 1 to 1, but less 
than 2 to 1.

[11.22] A Substantive Victory 
results when one side has a ratio of 
its own Victory Points to its 
opponent’s Victory Points of 2 to 1 
or better, but less than 3 to 1.

[11.23] A Decisive Victory results 
when one side
has a ratio of its own Victory 
Points to its opponent’s Victory 
Points of 3 to 1 or better.
[11.24] For any Victory Condition, a 
“higher” level of victory is always 
considered just as good. For 
instance, a Victory Condition that 
called for a “Marginal Victory and 
control of hex ‘M”’ would be 
considered fulfilled if hex ‘M’ was 
controlled and a Substantive or 
Decisive Victory had been achieved.

[11.25] When Victory Conditions are 
given in absolute numbers of units, 
rather than in Victory Levels, Class 
D and Class E units are not counted.

[113] CONTROL
Many scenarios call for the 
“control” of a particular hex or 
hexes. Control is awarded the Player 
whose unit occupies the required 
hex. If there is no unit in the hex, 
it is controlled by the Player whose 
unit occupied the hex last. If the 
hex has never been occupied, neither 
side controls it, regardless of its 
geography.

[11.4] EXITING UNITS
[11.41] Once units have been moved 
off the mapsheet in pursuit of a 
Victory Condition, they may never be 
brought back, regardless of whether 
or not the condition is fulfilled.

[11.42] To exita unit from the 
mapsheet, the unit must have one 
Movement Point remaining to expend 
for it to “leave”.



[12.0] OPTIONAL RULES
Optional Rules are designed to 
permit a greater depth of realism in 
the game at the sacrifice of some 
degree of playability. The following 
options
may be used independently of one 
another, or in any combination.

Certain ones will be strongly 
recommended by particular scenarios. 
Players should be fully conversnt 
with the game system before 
attempting to add any of the 
options.


[13.0] PANIC
COMMENTARY:
Each unit in PRESTAGS has a Victory 
Point value equal to the unit’s 
Melee Strength divided by two 
(counting Dot Melee Values as one; 
all fractions rounded up), plus its 
Fire Strength (if any). The total of 
all units’ Victory Points is an 
expression of the army’s worth. All 
armies in the scenarios have a 
numerical Panic Level, a percentage 
of its Victory Point total.


When losses in Victory Points attain 
the Panic
Level, the army’s organization 
begins to disintegrate. The Panic 
Level is reached when Enemy
Victory Points (gained through the 
destruction of
Friendly units) reach the Friendly 
Army’s Panic
Level.

GENERAL RULE:
For every Movement Phase that a unit 
is Panicked, it must attempt to move 
up to its Movement Allowance to a 
hex as many hexes as possible from 
the nearest Enemy unit. In so 
moving, it must always attempt to 
move from hex to hex, each of which 
is always further from any Enemy 
unit.

Units may never move into prohibited 
terrain, into Enemy-occupied hexes, 
or adjacent to Enemy fire units. It 
is possible that units may not move 
at all, if they were surrounded and 
no hex would place them further from 
Enemy units.

If possible, Panicked units must 
move off the mapsheet; in which case 
they are counted for Victory Points 
as if their loss had occurred in 
regular combat. They cannot return.

PROCEDURE:
Panic is determined the instant one 
side’s Panic Level is equaled or 
surpassed. The entire army panics at 
once. The following are not 
panicked: all units stacked with or 
adjacent to “1” or “2” level Leaders 
and all units stacked with “3” or 
“4” level Leaders.

Panicked units may not attack; they 
defend at one-half their normal 
Melee Strength (fractions retained). 
Panicked units that are attacked by 
Fire or Melee Attack suffer all 
combat results and, in addition, are 
eliminated by “Disruption” results.

[13.1] DETERMINATION OF PANIC
[13.11] Panic may be attained in the 
middle of a phase, at the instant 
losses reach or surpass one side’s 
Panic Level.

[13.12] if the exact Panic Level is 
reached at
exactly the same time by both sides, 
the side which was the Defender in 
the aetion is considered to panic. 
The Attacker does not panic.

[13.13] If both sides surpass the 
Panic Level at exactly the same 
time, the side which surpasses its 
Panic Level by the greater number of 
Victory Points (i.e., lost more in 
the battle) is considered to be the 
panicked army. The other side may 
never panic then or thereafter.

[13.2] RALLYING
[13.21] All units that did not panic 
at the instant of
panic in their army remain 
unpanicked indefinitely. Once the 
instant of panic has passed, no more 
units (of either side) ever panic, 
regardless of losses to either side.
[13.22] Leader units alone may Rally 
panicked Friendly units. At the end 
of each Friendly Movement Phase, all 
panicked units adjacent to or 
stacked with “1” and “2” level 
Leaders and all panicked units 
stacked with “3” and “4” level 
Leaders are “rallied”, i.e., 
returned to unpanicked state for the 
remainder of the game.



[14.0]	MELEE COMBAT AND 
ELEVATION
GENERAL RULE:
All hexes adjacent to dark-border 
Slope hexsides are Hilltop hexes. 
All hexes with Slope markings (see: 
Terrain Effects) are Slope hexes, 
which are lower than Hilltop hexes 
in elevation. All other terrain is 
called Ground-level and is lower 
than Slope elevation; all Ground-
level terrain is considered equal in 
elevation.

[14.1] ATTACKING INTO
HIGHER ELEVATION
[14.11] Any Class A or Class B unit 
on a Ground Level hex attacking a 
Slope hex, or on a Slope hex 
attacking a Hilltop hex, has its 
Melee Attack Strength cut in half.
[14.12] Any fractions caused by this 
reduction are
retained and combat “odds” are 
calculated in the normal way. Thus, 
a Class A or B unit with an Attack 
Strength of five on a slope hex 
attacking a Hilltop hex would attack 
with 2½ Combat Strength Points, it 
would attack a unit defending with 
two Strength Points at Combat Odds 
of “one-to-one”.

[14.13] This elevation penalty is 
calculated before the addition of 
any Combat Strength Bonus from 
Leader units, and before the 
correction (if any) for Flank 
Attacks.
[14.14] The presence of units not 
from Classes A and B in no way 
affects the penalty; it is still 
assessed.

[14.2] ATTACKS ON SLOPES
[14.21] Any Class A or Class B unit 
on a Slope hex
attacking any unit on another Slope 
hex has its Melee Attack Strength 
cut in half.
[14.22] Fractions are retained and 
the penalty is calculated before 
Leader Bonus is added (see:
14.12,	14.13).
[14.23] This penalty is extracted 
regardless of whether the defender’s 
Slope hex is on a contiguous Slope 
“line” or merely an unconnected, but 
adjacent, Slope hex.

[143] RESISTANCE TO DISRUPTION
[1431] Class A and Class B units on 
Slope hexes may ignore all 
“Disruption” combat results, from 
Melee or Fire Combat.
[1432] This resistance of Class A 
and Class B units on Slopes in no 
way influences any other unit 
stacked with them on the Slope hex 
(including Leader units, who must 
suffer results normally).


[15.0] TACTICAL
CONCESSION
GENERAL RULE:
At any time, in any scenario, a 
Player may move his forces off the 
map to avoid greater casualties. The 
withdrawing Player automatically 
grants his opponent a Substantive 
Victory (unless the opposing Player 
has achieved or does achieve a 
higher level of victory before the 
withdrawal is completed).

PROCEDURE:
Units must be exited off the 
mapsheet from road hexes.
CASES:
[15.1] Granting a Tactical 
Concession means the granting Player 
cannot win the game. His opponent 
will gain at least a Substantive 
Victory (despite any printed Victory 
Conditions in the scenario) and 
possibly a higher level of Victory 
(per his Victory Conditions). The 
Substantive Victory is awarded even 
if, by some chance, the strategic 
situation should change after the 
declaration of “concession”.

[15.2] The Concession is not 
complete until all units of the 
conceding Player are exited, 
destroyed or immobile. Players may, 
of course, agree to terminate a game 
mutually.

[153] Units once moved off the 
mapsheet may never return.

[15.4] Tactical Concession in no way 
interferes with the working of the 
optional rule Panic (13.0). In 
Panic, there is the chance that the 
situation can be reversed through 
rallied units. A Tactical Concession 
is a final concession of victory, 
leaving only the winner’s level of 
Victory open to variations.



[16.0] FACING
GENERAL RULE:
All units have a particular side 
which is their front (three 
hexsides), as indicated by the unit 
type symbol on each counter. The 
three rear hexsides are referred to 
as the “Flank” of the unit. This 
reflects the battle formation 
orientation of the particular group 
of men that the counter represents.

PROCEDURE:
As a unit moves, it may only enter 
one of the three hexes that are to 
its front. Before it enters a hex, 
its facing is reoriented so that the 
front (top) of the counter is facing 
the hex to be entered.
 
A unit may only attack Enemy units 
in hëxes which it fronts upon. A 
unit may only use its Melee Strength 
for defense if attacked solely from 
Front hexes; if it is attacked in 
part or whole through Flank 
hexsides, it defends at one-half of 
its Melee Strength. Obviously, it is 
extremely important for Players to 
pay close attention to their units’ 
facing.

[16.1] EFFECT ON MOVEMENT

[16.11] Although units may only move 
into their Front hexes, they may at 
any time change their facing within 
a single hex up to 180 degrees by 
expending one Movement Point.
[16.12] Units stacked together in 
the same hex need not be faced in 
the same manner.

[16.13] Units found to be 
ambiguously faced after the Movement 
Phase may be adjusted by the Enemy 
Player to one of the two possible 
hexsides.

[16.2] EFFECT ON MELEE COMBAT
[16.21] Units attacked through a 
flank hexside defend at the “Flank” 
rate; that is, one-half of
their Melee Combat Strength. A 
combination Front and Flank Attack 
is considered a Flank Attack 
(supercedes rule 7.5).

[16.22] All fractions are retained 
in computing Flank Attacks.
[16.23] Units in the same hex faced 
differently will frequently defend 
at different rates, depending upon 
whether they are Flank Attacked or 
not. Note that this does not 
conflict with case 16.21 where a 
combination attack upon one (or 
many) units requires a flank 
reduction.

[16.24] The provisions of “Flanking 
Attacks” are ignored when this rule 
is used.

[16.25] Units with Melee Strength in 
brackets, when attacked from the 
Flank, defend at one-half of their 
Melee Defense Strength. For 
instance, an HC unit with a Melee 
Strength of[4], defends normally at 
“two” Strength Points, and would 
defend against a Flank Attack with 
“one” Strength Point.

[163] EFFECT ON FIRE COMBAT

[1631] Fire units may only attack 
through their front hexes. This is 
true of normal Fire Combat and 
Defensive Fire.
[16.32] The flank hexes of fire 
units do not prohibit Enemy movement 
(this overrules case 6.41 of 
PRESTAGS Defensive Fire).
[1633] In defending against Fire 
Combat of any kind, facing has no 
bearing whatsoever. Defense against 
Fire Combat is always based on a 
Terrain Fire Protection Strength.



[17.0] RETREAT BEFORE
COMBAT
GENERAL RULE:
If attacked by Melee Combat, any 
unit in a hex may retreat one hex to 
an unblocked (i.e., passable) hex If 
the printed Movement Allowance of 
all the defending units in that hex 
exceeds the printed Movement 
Allowance of the fastest attacking 
unit by three Movement Points or 
more. if the retreat before combat 
option is used, the attacker may 
advance into the vacated hex and no 
further.

CASES:
[17.1] If a unit is unable to 
retreat due to terrain or stacking 
restrictions, it must remain and 
receive the attack.

[17.2] Victorious units advancing 
after the “retreat before combat” 
are not subject to Defensive Fire as 
a result of their advance. The 
advance is considered to have come 
about from Combat, not Movement.

[17.3] Units that retreat before 
combat are subject to any attack 
brought to bear against their new 
hex. They may not retreat again, nor 
may any units in the hex to which 
they retreat; i.e., they force any 
hex to which they retreat to receive 
attacks.

[17.4] Units that advance into 
vacated hexes may not attack in that 
Player-Turn.

[17.5] Some units in a hex may 
retreat, and others may be required 
to remain, dependent on their 
individual Movement Allowances.





[18.0] CONTACT
[18.1] Units engaged in Melee Attack 
which does not result in the 
elimination, half-elimination or 
disruption of one side or the other 
remain in Contact.
[18.2] Units in contact may not 
break off the action; i.e., leave 
the hex they were in at the 
establishment of Contact, until a 
decision is reached in some 
subsequent Game-Turn, nor may they 
change their facing.

[183] Additional units may join in 
an attack with units already in 
Contact, in which case the 
reinforcing units must observe the 
restriction of case
18.2.

[18.4] Place a Contact Marker on 
units involved in Contact 
situations.

[18.5] Contact terminates when one 
or the other side of the engagement 
is eliminated, half-eliminated, or 
disrupted by any combat.



[19.0] SIMULTANEOUS
MOVEMENT SEQUENCE
When using this Simultaneous 
Movement option, there is a new 
Sequence of Play employed. Each 
Player plots his movement, or Fire 
Combat (offensive or defensive), or 
Melee Combat for each unit 
simultaneously; and then the units 
are moved or engage in Combat 
according to the plot. To use 
simultaneity, Players should consult 
20.0, 21.0 and
22.0.

[19.1] SEQUENCE OUTLINE:
THE GAME-TURN

(A)	OPERATIONS PLOT PHASE: The 
Players
simultaneously and secretly record 
the tasks (see
21.1) that each unit will perform on 
the
Game-Turn.
(B) FIRE COMBAT RESOLUTION PHASE: 
All
units plotted to engage in Offensive 
Fire do so, barring disruption in 
earlier phases of the current Game-
Turn.
(C)	MELEE COMBAT RESOLUTION PHASE:
All units plotted to engage in Melee 
Combat now do so, barring disruption 
in earlier phases of the current 
Game-Turn (e.g., from Enemt Fire 
Combat).
(D)	MOVEMENT RESOLUTION PHASE: All
units plotted to engage in movement 
now do so, barring disruption in 
earlier phases of the current Game-
Turn (e.g., from Enemy Fire or Melee 
Combat).
(E)	DEFENSIVE FIRE COMBAT 
RESOLUTION
PHASE:	All units plotted to 
engage in Defensive
Fire may do so, firing at an Enemy 
unit of their
choice which has moved adjacent to 
them. Units (F) TURN RECORD PHASE: 
The Players record the passage of 
one Game-Turn.


[20.0] HOW TO USE THE
SIMULTANEOUS
MOVEMENT
PLOT CHART
GENERAL RULE:
During each Operation Plot Phase, 
both Players must record each unit’s 
task (see 21.1, Individual Task 
Summary) on his Simultaneous 
Movement Plot Chart. Each unit may 
execute only one type of task per 
Game-Turn.

PROCEDURE:
The Owning Player writes the 
identity number of the unit in the 
first column along with the 
operation code (see 21.1) to be 
performed. If a unit is moving, the 
hexes moved through (one-by-one) 
must be listed. If a unit is firing, 
it must be specified whether 
Defensively or Offensively; and if 
Offensively, the target hex must be 
given. If a unit is melee attacking, 
the target hex must be
given. If a given hex takes more 
than one Movement Point to enter, 
the number of Movement Points 
expended to enter is also written 
down.
To make a Plot Chart, divide an 
ordinary sheet of lined paper into 
½” wide columns. One unit is listed 
on each line; hex numbers are listed 
in the columns to the right. Pre-
printed Plot Charts are available 
from Simulations Publications (see 
current catalog for details).

[20.1] SECRECY AND HONESTY
Each Player’s Simultaneous Movement 
Plot Chart is to be hidden from the 
other Player until the end of the 
game. if there is any question about 
the other Player’s orders, the 
Player is advised to write them down 
and compare them with the 
Simultaneous Movement Plot Chart at 
the end of the game. A Player who 
secretly violates the rules to gain 
an advantage, forfeits the game.

[20.2] ORDER OF COMBAT
Combat occurs in different Phases. 
All combat in the same Phase is 
considered simultaneous; all combat 
in different Phases is strictly 
sequential and consequently the 
results are cumulative.
[20.21] A unit may always complete 
an attack if it suffers an adverse 
combat result in the same phase of 
its own attack. For instance, a unit 
which is engaging in Melee combat 
would complete its attack even if it 
were disrupted by Enemy combat 
during the same phase.
[20.22] A unit may not perform its 
plotted task if it
• suffers an adverse combat result 
in a phase prior to the phase of its 
execution. Therefore, a unit plotted 
to Melee Attack could pot do so if 
it were disrupted in the previous 
Fire Combat Phase. Strict attention 
is necessary to the Sequence of 
Play.

[203] SIMULTANEITY OF MOVEMENT
All movement plotted for execution 
in the same Phase is considered 
simultaneous. All Movement must be 
executed; units may never alter 
their Movement in response to Enemy 
actions.

[20.4] INVIOLABILITY OF THE PLOT
Once the Operation Plot Phase is 
completed for the Game-Turn, the 
Players must attempt to fulfill the 
“orders”. There can never be any 
change in the Plot through the 
volition of the Players once the 
Operation Plot Phase is completed. 
The only reason for variation 
between what is plotted and what is 
executed is in conditions brought 
about by enemy operations that 
render the Friendly Plot impossible. 
Plots written either indecipherably 
or with operations impossible to 
execute within the rules are treated 
as “no plot”; that is, the unit 
simply remains stationary for the 
Game-Turn.



[21.0]	INDIVIDUAL TASKS SUMMARY
GENERAL RULE:
During a given Game-Turn, each unit 
may only perform one task.

PROCEDURE:
During the Operation Plot Phase, the 
Player may write down any of the 
following tasks of which the unit is 
capable (obviously, Melee units 
cannot execute Defensive Fire). Each 
task is identified by a letter code, 
which may be used in assigning the 
task on the Simultaneous Movement 
Plot Chart.

No more than one of the detailed 
tasks may be allocated to a single 
unit in a given Game-Turn. Once the 
task is allocated, the assigned unit 
must attempt to execute the task 
during the appropriation Execution 
Segment of the various Phases (see
19.1).
[21.1] UNIT TASKS
OF OFFENSIVE FIRE: a fire unit must
	identify its target hex. 
DF	DEFENSIVE FIRE: a fire unit will 
be cap
	able of using Defensive Fire 
upon any 
	Enemy unit that moves adjacent 
to it 
	during the Movement Resolution 
Phase. 
ML	MELEE: a Melee unit must 
identify the hex
	it is attacking. A fire unit 
loses its Defensive 
	Fire Zone for a Game-Turn in 
which it is 
	plotted to Melee (ML). Fire 
units engaging 
	in Melee Attack are treated only 
as Melee 
	Units for that Game-Turn. 
MV	MOVEMENT: a unit must identify 
all 
	hexes through which it intends 
to move and 
	its destination hex. A fire unit 
loses its Zone 
	of Control for defensive 
purposes for a 
	Game-Turn in which it is plotted 
to move 
	(MV). Fire units engaging in 
movement 
	have no Defensive Fire 
capability, nor do 
	they inhibit Enemy units in 
hexes adjacent 
	to them.

[21.2] OPERATION INTERRUPTION
After the Operation Plot, there are 
several ways a unit can be deterred 
from completing its plot:
through disruption caused by any 
activity of phases prior to its own 
execution phase for the Game-Turn; 
or through destruction of its 
“target” as a result of prior 
phases; or through any combat result 
(such as advance by its “target” 
unit out of the “target” hex) that 
makes its plot impossible to 
execute.

[22.0] MOVEMENT
RESOLUTION
[22.1] CONTINUITY OF MOVEMENT
[22.11] Movement must be plotted 
continuously, without any pause or 
“dead” time. The movement must be 
accomplished hex-by-hex to the 
destination (by any route) with no 
gaps between hexes.

Therefore, a Movement Plot calling 
for three clear hexes of movement, a 
two Movement Point “pause”, and 
another two clear hexes of movement 
would not be allowed, if the Player 
wished the unit to move five hexes, 
it would have to be plotted 
continuously on the first five lines 
of the Plot Chart.

[22.12] Movement is executed hex-by-
hex. There is no differentiation 
between the amount of time it takes 
a “fast” unit to cover the same 
distance as a “slow” unit. All 
movement i4s executed hex-by-her.

[22.2] OPPOSING FORCES ENTERING
THE SAME HEX
[22.21] if units of opposing forces 
attempt to enter the same hex in the 
Movement Resolution Phase, the force 
with the greater number of Melee 
Attack Strength Points will enter 
the hex first.

[22.22] Bracketed Melee Attack 
Strength Points are undifferentiated 
from non-bracketed Strength Points 
in the Attack Strength Point 
calculation.

[22.23] if opposing forces are of 
the same Melee Attack Strength Point 
as they attempt to enter the same 
hex in the Movement Resolution 
Phase, the die is rolled and the 
higher result enters the hex first.

[223] OPPOSING FORCES
CROSSING THE SAME HEXSIDE
Opposing forces that attempt to 
cross the same hexside or enter the 
hex of an Enemy unit finished with 
movement must stop. There is no 
further movement by either side; and 
there is no combat (since they were 
plotted for movement and all combat 
segments for the Game-Turn are 
completed).
[23.0]	DEFENSIVE STRENGTH 
VARIATION

[23.1] UNITS ATTACKED
WHEN PLOTTED TO MOVE
[23.11] If units are plotted to move 
and are attacked by Melee Combat, 
they defend at one-half their normal 
Defense Strength (fractions 
retained).

[23.12] If units are plotted to move 
and are attacked by Fire Combat, 
they defend at their normal Fire 
Protection Strength (see: Terrain 
Effects Chart for full Fire 
Protection Strength listings).

[23.2] UNITS ATTACKED
WHEN PLOTTED TO FIRE [OF or DF]
if units are plotted to use Fire 
Combat (Offensive or Defensive) and 
they are attacked by any means, they 
defend at full strength (Melee 
defense or Fire Protection 
Strength). They may still execute 
their plot.

[233] UNITS ATTACKED
WHEN PLOTTED TO MELEE ATTACK
If units are plotted to Melee Attack 
and they are attacked by any means, 
they defend at full strength (Melee 
Defense or Fire Protection 
Strength). It is entirely possible 
that a unit might defend with its 
Melee Defense Strength and attack 
with its Melee Attack Strength in 
the same Melee Combat Execution 
Phase.



HOW TO USE THE TRACKS
ON THE MAP
Each Player keeps track of the 
Victory Points he has scored on the 
Victory Point Record. Use the three 
appropriately colored arrowhead 
markers to record the Victory Points 
as they are scored by placing the 
markers in the appropriate boxes. 
Players should be careful not to 
move the markers of the opposing 
Player. For example, if the current 
total of Victory Points is “27”, 
there would be a marker in the “000” 
box, the “20” box, and the “7” box.

To begin the game. one of the 
Players places the Game-Turn Marker 
in the first space on the Turn 
Record Track. The Players follow the 
Sequence of Play until the first 
Game-Turn is complete, at which time 
the Game-Turn Marker is moved to the 
number two space on the Turn Record 
Track. This procedure is followed at 
the end of each Game-Turn, until the 
final Game-Turn in the scenario 
being played. [Note that most 
scenarios end before the Game-Turn 
Marker reaches the final space, 
numbered 30, of the Turn Record 
Track.]
