<p class="title">SAVING THE POSITION</p>
<p>The game can be saved at any time. What is being saved is a 'snapshot' of where all the pieces are on the board and what state they are in.</p>
<p>To save a position follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Check all the pieces are as you want them to be saved - check the 'Game Turn' marker, check the game-turn calculator, check the City Control boxes, do you want to leave units marked or unmarked? "--REMEMBER TO PICK APPROPRIATE TURN BUTTON BEFORE CREATING SAVE DATA..."" - this determines which side is hidden when a new game is re-loaded with hidden movement chosen.
<li>Press the 'create save-data' button located at the bottom of the screen
<li>A new window will pop up full of numbers seperated by commas - this is the data that provides the 'snapshot'
<li>In this new window choose <b><u>E</u>dit | Select <u>A</u>ll</b> to highlight all the data
<li>Then choose <b><u>E</u>dit | <u>C</u>opy</b> to copy all the data
<ul>
<li>DO NOT choose <b><u>F</u>ile | Save <u>A</u>s...</b> or <b><u>F</u>ile | <u>S</u>ave</b> in the new window as this will not save the data correctly!</ul>
<li>Open a Notepad window (<b>Start | <u>P</u>rograms | Accessories | Notepad</b>)
<li>Paste your copied data into this Notepad window (<b><u>E</u>dit | <u>P</u>aste</b>)
<li>Now save this Notepad window in order to save your data... Choose <b><u>F</u>ile | Save <u>A</u>s...</b> from the Notepad menu bar. Save the file with an appropriate name in an appropriate place.
<ul><li>You could then clear the Notepad window ( <b><u>E</u>dit | Select <u>A</u>ll</b> then press the <b>Delete</b> key) and so have it all ready for the next bit of data you want to save.</ul>
</ol>

<p class="title">RELOADING THE POSITION</p>
<p>Before re-loading a new position you MUST 'Refresh' the game. This is done by pressing the 'Refresh' button on the toolbar or choosing <b><u>V</u>iew | <u>R</u>efresh</b> (or pressing the 'F5' key). 'Refreshing' wipes out all existing moves and puts the game back to initial positions. Check you do not want to save your position before you 'refresh'.</p>
<p>To re-load a position follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your data should be saved in a .txt file somewhere
<li>Find the appropriate file and double-click it to open it
<li>The data will be opened up in its own Notepad window. Select the data by choosing <b><u>E</u>dit | Select <u>A</u>ll</b>
<li>Copy the data by choosing <b><u>E</u>dit | <u>C</u>opy</b>
<li>We will now paste the data into the game: <b>right</b>-click with the mouse over the 're-load' box at the very bottom of the game screen - this will pop-up a little menu of options - choose <b><u>P</u>aste</b>
<li>The data should all now be visible inside the 're-load' box - press the 'press to re-load' button
<li>Voila!
</ol>
