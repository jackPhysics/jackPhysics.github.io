<p>Historical Notes: Saladin proclaimed a jihad (holy war) and retook Palestine. At Hattin (or Tiberias, as it is sometimes called) the King of Jerusalem, Guy de Lusignan, had an army made up of the garrisons of the principal Crusader cities. Saladin separated the Crusader infantry from the cavalry and defeated them in detail, capturing the True Cross in the process and leaving the Crusader forces in disarray in Palestine. This led to the raising of the Third Crusade.
