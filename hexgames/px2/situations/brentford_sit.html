<p>Special Rules:
  <ul>
    <li>No command control, all units have full MF at all times.
    <li>No defensive fire, but still must stop on moving adjacent to fire unit.
    <li>Inf. and Art. either move or fire in a turn, may not do both.
    <li>RC and DR may fire at END of movement, and still melee in the same turn as they fire.
    <li>'DR' units may dismount (press 'C'). Dismounting/mounting counts as the move for that turn.

    </ul>
