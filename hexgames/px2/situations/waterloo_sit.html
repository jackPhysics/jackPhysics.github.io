<p>Special Rules:
  <ul>
    <li>Stacking=4; except for OO troops which are stacking=1.
    <li>No command control, all units have full MF at all times.
    <li>No defensive fire, but still must stop on moving adjacent to fire unit.
    <li>Inf. (not 'OO') and Art. either move or fire in a turn, may not do both. 'OO' and horse may fire and move.
    <li>'OO' troops (the 'LI', 'OO'=open order) have double Fire Protection Strength.
      They may not stack with other units.
    <li>'GN' ('guns', artillery) units have a starred range
      - can fire at double range for 1/2 attack factor,
      can fire at triple range for 1/4 attack factor (round fractions downwards).
    <li>Guns only fire if 'unlimbered', but have no MF. Limbering/unlimbering costs 3 MF.
    <li>'PINNING': moving away from adjacent non-destroyed enemy units are disrupted at the end of their move;
      cavalry may spend 3MF to avoid being disrupted.
    </ul>
