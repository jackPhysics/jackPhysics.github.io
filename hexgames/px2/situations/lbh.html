<p>LITTLE BIG HORN </span>(A.D 1876)</span></p>

<p>U.S. Cavalry: 12xBC*, 1x1L, 2x2L, 1x3L. VP
100, PL -. Deploy: north-east edge. Stacking: 2. Leadership: see extra rules</p>

<p>Native Americans: 37xHB*, 13xTP , 1x2L, 2x3L, 2x4L, 1x5L. VP 182, PL -. Deploy: in villages.
Stacking: 2. Leadership: see extra rules</p>

<p>Game
Length:20
Game-Turns.</p>

<p>Victory Conditions: Side achieving the most victory points wins. Native Americans start off with 20 points. So 7th Cavalry to win
   must achieve at least 20 more victory points than Native Americans. 7th Cavalry can still win, even if all units lost.
   So achieveing 121 VP is an automatic victory for 7th Cavalry.</p>


<p>Special Rules:</p>
<ul><li>units outside of command radius MAY NOT MOVE, they may still fire.
  <li>7th Cavalry units may dismount/mount up. Unit can change formation after it's movement, otherwise changing takes whole turn.
  <li>Dismounted units have double fire protection strength.
  <li>FPS: river/ford=1; clear/slope = 3; woods = 4.
  <li>units firing or attacking upwards through hillcrest hexsides have their attack factor halved.
  <li>Native American units are untried. When involved in melee combat check for the actual value.
  At any time when the unit is not disrupted and not adjacent to an enemy unit it may be 'rallied' back to 'untried'('?') status,
  this counts as it's move for the turn.
  <li>'Tipi' units are deployed in any 'blank' village hexes (the plain yellow hexes), 1 counter per hex.
  <li>'Tipi' units can only be attacked by melee combat, and only if no native american combat units are in the hex. They are automatically eliminated on being attacked.
</ul>
