    <p class="first">Before you visit these pages note there are various key-board shortcuts available to help (press the HELP button to find out more).<br> 
      There are buttons available lower down for calling up CRTs, TECs etc 
      or a help sheet that lists the keyboard short cuts. 
      Most of the shortcuts can also be accessed through the 'hopper' which appears whenever you click on a piece.<br>
    Pieces can be moved by dragging or by clicking to choose and then clicking on where you want them to go.</p>
    <p class="first">The most important shortcut to know at the start is the "1" key shrinks the board and pieces (zoom out),<br>
      and the "2" expands the board and pieces (zoom in).</p>

    <p>Play the original game or try out new armies and/or new boards.<br>
    It's best to select new armies/boards before starting to play - changing halfway through a game could lead to unpredictable results!</p>

     <p class="kr0">Here is the version of the game ready for you to choose your boards and choose your armies (every time you choose the <i>same</i> board
       the board will get rotated and/or reflected - there are 4 'versions' of each board) - now includes the option that you can choose random boards and armies from all the available options.
     <br>(at the last count it was 85 different armie, and 54 different boards - each board available in 4 possible rotations/reflections)</p>
